Dolphin emulator is a easy to use, fast, and accurate gamecube & wii emulator.

It is on 4 platforms. Mac, Windows, Linux & Android. We will be covering the PC versions.

First, we need to download dolphin. For windows, download it from [here](https://dl.dolphin-emu.org/builds/6f/62/dolphin-master-5.0-19501-x64.7z).

For macos, download it from [here](https://dl.dolphin-emu.org/builds/a2/40/dolphin-master-5.0-19501-universal.dmg).

For linux, it depends on your distro. I will show you how to get it for **arch linux.**. Open up a terminal window and proceed to type in **yay -S dolphin-emu**.

##  Setting up the emulator.

1. Extract the .zip or .dmg file with a zip explorer (7z, winrar, winzip).
2. Once extracted, boot up the emulator. 
3. You will see a screen that says **Dolphin could not find any gamecube/wii ISO's or wads.** This is normal as we have not set a game directory.
4. To set a game directory, Double click inside dolphin and a file explorer window will show up. Set it to the directory where your game files are.
5. To boot into a game, click on the game after dolphin finds it. Do not do that yet, first we shall configure the emulator.

## Configuring your controller.

It is very easy to configure dolphin. You can use almost any controller! Lets walk through that.

1. Grab the controller and connect it to your pc via bluetooth. Heres a example for a ps4 controller [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/792747/how-to-pair-ps4-controller/)
2. Inside dolphin, press the **controllers** button at the top of the dolphin window.
3. You will see a panel with windows that say Gamecube controllers, and Wii Remotes.
4. Click the configure button on the gamecube or wii remote window, depending on which console your going to play.
5. You will see a panel that says device, make it the controller you plan to connect.
6. It should automap, but if it doesnt, map it yourself manually by clicking on each button with your mouse, then pressing the button you want it to be on your controller.

## Graphical Configuration.

1. In the standard dolphin menu, click on **Graphics**
2. You can now choose your backend in the general panel, your resolution and other things in the enhancement panel, and hacks for optimizing things. Only use advanced if you plan to debug.
3. You now should have configured your graphics settings. Be warned you will need a beefy gpu to crank it to 4K.

## Booting a game.

To boot a game, just double click on it as previously stated.

And thats it! Enjoy hours of fun with your favourite gamecube and wii games at high resolutions!
